# Crave.inc
Crave.inc is a grocery tracking website. It lets you keep a track of your groceries and notifies you a day before its expiration. The website also suggests you recipes according to the hero ingredient of your dish. An API key is used to access the database of recipes. It also recommends you items based on your previous purchases. User can signup through their email id. A shopping list is also created to maintain a record of the items the user needs to buy.

I made this project in a group of 4 for Csi Tsec's Rubix Hackathon 2022.
